            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>My name is Taylor Johnson, and I started PlantYolk from my backyard in Atlantic City, New Jersey. I always knew eggplant juice was healthy and tasted great, so I started making bottles for my friends to try. I kept experimenting with different fruits and flavors to achieve the perfect drink. Eventually, my friends told me we were sitting on a gold mine if I was willing to sell it. I was never in it for the money, but I decided to try.</p>
                <p>The next thing I knew, my whole city was drinking PlantYolk eggplant juice. People ran to me on the streets telling me how much better they felt. If I could change Atlantic City with a drink recipe, maybe I could change the world. Me and a couple of my friends got to work assembling a team and trademarking the name. Thus, the PlantYolk company was born.</p>
                <p>We came up with the PlantYolk name for a couple of reasons. Plant is obviously the ending of eggplant, and yolk refers to the egg part of eggplant because of egg yolk. We put them together to form the PlantYolk name. This name is also unique and makes you take a second look at what it is about. Our hope is that when people take that second look, they peruse what we have to offer and give it a try.</p>
                <p>Ever since that moment of seeing people happy while drinking my eggplant juice, it has become my mission to sell PlantYolk across the world. It would be a dream for me if you wanted to help my mission and purchase some eggplant juice. Post to socials with #YolkAroundTheWorld and help show me that my dream is becoming realized.</p>
